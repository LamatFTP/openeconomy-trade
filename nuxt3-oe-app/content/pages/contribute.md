```
Support Financially
```

### Section Subtitle
```
No VCs. No profit motive. Community-funded.
```

### Why We Need Support
```
OpenEconomy is non-profit by design. We don't:
- Take a cut of exchanges
- Sell user data
- Have venture capital backing
- Plan to "exit"

We're building public infrastructure, not a business.
Financial support keeps the lights on and development moving.
```
