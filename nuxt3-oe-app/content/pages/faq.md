## CATEGORY 1: GETTING STARTED

### Q1
```
Q: What is OpenEconomy?

A: OpenEconomy is a platform for fair skill exchange. Instead of paying 
   money for services, you trade skills with others based on time-value 
   equivalence. 
   
   For example: 4 hours of gardening at $25/hr = 2.5 hours of cooking 
   at $40/hr. Both equal $100 in value—fair exchange.
```

### Q2
```
Q: Is it free to use?

A: Yes, completely free. We don't charge fees, take a percentage of 
   exchanges, or have premium tiers. OpenEconomy is non-profit and 
   community-funded through donations.
```

### Q3
```
Q: How do I sign up?

A: Click "Get Started" and create an account with your email or by 
   connecting a crypto wallet. Then set your hourly value, add your 
   skills, and you're ready to exchange. Takes about 5 minutes.
```

### Q4
```
Q: Do I need any special skills?

A: Everyone has valuable skills! Cooking, gardening, tutoring, pet sitting, 
   handyman work, design, coding, language teaching, elder care—anything 
   you can do that others need counts.
```

### Q5
```
Q: Is this available in my country?

A: OpenEconomy is global and available everywhere with internet access. 
   However, most exchanges happen locally, so the experience depends on 
   how many participants are in your area. Help grow your local community!
```

## CATEGORY 2: VALUE & EXCHANGE

### Q6
```
Q: How do I decide my hourly value?

A: Your hourly value (baseline) is what you believe your time is worth. 
   If you have a job, divide your annual salary by 2,000 hours. If not, 
   consider what someone with your skills/experience would reasonably earn.
   
   This isn't about being expensive or cheap—it's about creating fair 
   exchanges. You can change it anytime.
```

### Q7
```
Q: What if someone's rate is much higher than mine?

A: That's fine! The math still works. If they charge $100/hr and you 
   charge $25/hr, you'd provide 4 hours for every 1 hour they provide. 
   Different time, same value, fair exchange.
```

### Q8
```
Q: What if an exchange isn't perfectly balanced?

A: Small imbalances are normal and tracked as credit/debit. If you 
   receive $10 more value than you provided, you have -$10 credit. 
   It evens out across multiple exchanges over time.
   
   The system warns you if an exchange is more than 10% imbalanced.
```

### Q9
```
Q: Can I exchange with someone without giving something back immediately?

A: Yes! You can "bank" credit by providing services now and receiving 
   services later from anyone in the community. Your balance can be 
   negative (you owe) or positive (community owes you).
```

### Q10
```
Q: What if I don't like the work someone did?

A: First, communicate directly—most issues can be resolved through 
   conversation. If that fails, you can raise a dispute. A neutral 
   mediator will help resolve it. Rate honestly so others know what 
   to expect.
```

### Q11
```
Q: Can I cancel an exchange?

A: Before acceptance: Cancel freely, no penalty.
   After acceptance: You can cancel, but it affects your reputation.
   During work: Communicate issues early. Canceling mid-exchange 
   is discouraged and impacts your standing.
```

---

## CATEGORY 3: TRUST & SAFETY

### Q12
```
Q: How do I know people are trustworthy?

A: Every participant has a visible reputation:
   
   • Trust tier (Newcomer → Active → Trusted → Verified → Champion)
   • Completion rate (% of exchanges finished)
   • Average rating (1-5 stars)
   • Reviews from past exchanges
   • Time on platform
   
   Start with Trusted or higher participants if you're cautious.
```

### Q13
```
Q: What if someone doesn't complete their part?

A: 1. Try to communicate and resolve directly
   2. If that fails, raise a dispute
   3. A neutral mediator reviews the case
   4. If unresolved, a council of Champions decides
   
   Non-completion affects their reputation significantly.
```

### Q14
```
Q: What if someone is inappropriate or harasses me?

A: Report them immediately through the platform or Discord moderators. 
   We take harassment seriously. Offenders face warnings, suspension, 
   or permanent removal depending on severity.
```

### Q15
```
Q: Is my personal information safe?

A: We collect minimal data and never sell it. You control what's visible 
   on your profile. Exchanges are recorded on blockchain for transparency, 
   but only wallet addresses—not personal details—are public.
```

### Q16
```
Q: How does dispute resolution work?

A: Three levels:
   
   Level 1 (48 hours): You and the other party try to resolve it directly.
   
   Level 2 (5 days): A neutral mediator (Verified+ member) reviews and 
   proposes a solution. Both parties can accept or reject.
   
   Level 3 (7 days): A council of 3 Champions makes a binding decision.

## CATEGORY 4: TECHNICAL

### Q17
```
Q: Do I need cryptocurrency to use OpenEconomy?

A: No! You can sign up with just email. The blockchain runs in the 
   background for transparency and trust, but you never need to buy, 
   hold, or understand crypto.
   
   Optional: Connect a wallet for additional features and full 
   decentralization.
```

### Q18
```
Q: What blockchain do you use?

A: We use Polygon (and plan to add Base) for recording exchanges. 
   These are low-cost, environmentally-friendly blockchains. 
   Users never pay gas fees—we cover all blockchain costs.
```

### Q19
```
Q: Is the code open source?

A: Yes, completely. Everything is on GitHub:
   github.com/openeconomy/trade
   
   You can review, fork, or contribute to any part of the project.
```

### Q20
```
Q: What happens to my data if OpenEconomy shuts down?

A: Your exchange history is recorded on-chain forever—no one can delete it. 
   Your profile data is exportable anytime. Since we're open source, the 
   community can continue the project even without the original team.
```

### Q21
```
Q: Is there a mobile app?

A: Not yet. The website is mobile-responsive and works well on phones. 
   Native iOS and Android apps are planned for Phase 4.
```

```
Q: How do I find people in my area?

```

### Q23
```
Q: Can I create a private group?

A: Yes! You can create communities with different visibility:
   
   • Public: Anyone can join
   • Approval: Admin approves members
   • Invite-only: By invitation only
   
   Requires Trusted tier to create communities.
```

### Q24
```
Q: How do I become a Champion?

A: Champions have:
   • 50+ completed exchanges
   • 4.8+ average rating
   • 90+ days on platform
   • No recent disputes against them
   
   There's no application—you earn it through participation.
