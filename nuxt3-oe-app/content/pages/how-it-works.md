## SECTION 2: STEP 1 - SET YOUR VALUE

### Step Number
```
01
```

### Step Title
```
Set Your Value
```

### Step Subtitle
```
You decide what your time is worth
```

### Main Content
```
Your "hourly baseline" is the foundation of fair exchange. 
It's how we calculate equivalent value between different skills.

This isn't about what the market pays—it's about what YOU believe 
your time and expertise are worth.
```

### How to Self-Assess

**Option A: You Have a Job**
```
Icon: Briefcase
Title: Based on your salary
Description: Take your annual salary, divide by 2,000 (working hours per year). 
That's a good starting point.

Example: $50,000/year ÷ 2,000 = $25/hour baseline
```

**Option B: You're Self-Employed**
```
Icon: User
Title: Based on your rates
Description: What do you charge (or would charge) for your services? 
Use that as your baseline.

Example: Freelance designer charging $60/hour → $60 baseline
```

**Option C: You're Not Working**
```
Icon: Heart
Title: Based on your skills
Description: Consider what someone with your experience would earn. 
Be honest, but don't undervalue yourself.

Example: 20 years of parenting experience → comparable to childcare professional
```

### Value Examples by Skill
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Skill Category        │ Typical Range    │ Factors     │
├───────────────────────┼──────────────────┼─────────────┤
│ General Labor         │ $15 - $30/hr     │ Physical    │
│ Skilled Trade         │ $25 - $60/hr     │ Training    │
│ Creative/Design       │ $30 - $100/hr    │ Portfolio   │
│ Technical/IT          │ $40 - $150/hr    │ Expertise   │
│ Professional Services │ $50 - $200/hr    │ License     │
│ Care/Support          │ $15 - $40/hr     │ Experience  │
│ Teaching/Coaching     │ $25 - $100/hr    │ Specialty   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Points
```
✓ You can change your baseline anytime
✓ Different skills can have different rates
✓ Community endorsements build trust in your value
✓ No one can tell you your value—only you decide
```

### Important Note
```
💡 Your baseline isn't about being "expensive" or "cheap."
   It's about creating FAIR exchanges.
   
   If you undervalue yourself, exchanges become unfair to you.
   If you overvalue yourself, you'll struggle to find matches.

DO:
✓ Be specific ("React/Node.js development" not just "coding")
✓ Include experience level ("10+ years woodworking")
✓ Mention any certifications or training
✓ Add a brief description of what you can do

DON'T:
✗ List skills you can't actually deliver on
✗ Be too vague ("I can help with stuff")
✗ Forget to add what you're looking for (needs)
```

### Also Add Your Needs
```
Your "needs" help the matching algorithm connect you with the right people.

Examples:
- "Looking for help with garden maintenance"
- "Need someone to teach me Spanish"
- "Want help setting up a small website"
- "Seeking childcare help 2 afternoons/week"
```

### Evaluating Potential Partners
```
Before proposing an exchange, check:

□ Trust Tier - How established are they in the community?
□ Completion Rate - Do they follow through on exchanges?
□ Reviews - What do others say about working with them?
□ Skills Match - Do their skills match your needs?
□ Value Compatibility - Are your hourly rates reasonably aligned?
□ Activity - Have they been active recently?
```

## SECTION 5: STEP 4 - EXCHANGE

### Step Number
```
04
```

### Step Title
```
Exchange Fairly
```

### Step Subtitle
```
Propose, agree, complete, confirm
```

### Main Content
```
Found a match? Here's how an exchange works from start to finish.
```

### Exchange Flow

**Phase 1: Propose**
```
Icon: Send
Title: Send a Proposal
Description: 
- Select the skill you want from them
- Estimate the hours needed
- System calculates value (hours × their rate)
- Offer what you'll provide in return
- System shows if exchange is balanced
- Add a note explaining what you need
- Submit proposal

Example Proposal:
"I'd like 3 hours of Spanish tutoring ($120 value at your $40/hr rate).
In exchange, I'll provide 2.4 hours of web design ($120 at my $50/hr rate).
I'm building a small business site and want to improve my Spanish for travel."
```

**Phase 2: Negotiate**
```
Icon: Chat
Title: Agree on Terms
Description:
- Recipient reviews proposal
- Can accept, counter, or decline
- Counter-proposals adjust hours or terms
- Continue until both agree
- Once accepted, exchange is "locked in"

Negotiation Example:
Original: 3 hours tutoring for 2.4 hours design
Counter: "Could we do 4 hours tutoring for 3.2 hours design? 
         I have a larger project than expected."
Final: Both agree to adjusted terms
```

**Phase 3: Complete**
```
Icon: Check
Title: Do the Work
Description:
- Provider delivers the service
- Track actual hours (may differ from estimate)
- Communicate throughout
- Provider marks "completed" when done

Tips:
- Be responsive to messages
- Deliver quality work
- Communicate if timelines change
- Document what was delivered
```

**Phase 4: Confirm**
```
Icon: Star
Title: Confirm & Rate
Description:
- Receiver confirms work was completed
- Both parties rate each other (1-5 stars)
- Leave brief review (optional but encouraged)
- Credit balances automatically updated
- Exchange recorded permanently

Rating Guidelines:
5 stars: Exceptional, exceeded expectations
4 stars: Good, would work with again
3 stars: Acceptable, met basic requirements
2 stars: Below expectations, some issues
1 star: Poor experience, significant problems
```

## SECTION 7: FAQ PREVIEW

### Section Headline
```
Common Questions
```

### Questions (5)

**Q1**
```
Q: What if an exchange is unbalanced?
A: The system warns you if values differ by more than 10%. 
   Small imbalances are recorded as credit/debit. 
   You don't need to balance every exchange perfectly—
   it evens out over time across multiple exchanges.
```

**Q2**
```
Q: What if someone doesn't complete their part?
A: First, try to work it out directly. If that fails, 
   you can raise a dispute. A neutral mediator (Verified+ member) 
   will help resolve it. Repeat offenders lose reputation.
```

**Q3**
```
Q: Can I change my hourly rate?
A: Yes, anytime. Changes apply to new exchanges only. 
   Existing agreements keep their original terms.
```

**Q4**
```
Q: Is this like bartering?
A: Similar concept, but smarter. Traditional barter requires 
   "double coincidence of wants" (you have what I need AND vice versa). 
   OpenEconomy uses time-value normalization, so you can exchange 
   with anyone and balance over time across multiple exchanges.
```

**Q5**
```
Q: Do I need cryptocurrency?
A: No! The blockchain records exchanges for transparency, 
   but you never need to buy, hold, or understand crypto. 
   It works in the background.
